Importing_new.m is a script that imports the raw data for Apple, Actigraph, and Kubios, and aligns them to the same start and end times, and creates/saves a Matlab workspace ALL.mat for further analysis. This is the slowest part of the analysis. This should be run first before subsequent analysis.

Accel.m  is a script that uses the saved ALL.mat workspace, and calculates HR from acceleration for Apple and Actigraph. Finally, it aligns the calculated HR values with those from PSG/EKG calculated in Kubios for statistical analysis in the file summary.xlsx.
